               Description="IBMachine is positioned at an intersection of emotion and apathy.
                    It explores 
                    this
                    duality in
                    the context 
                    of human 
                    designed machine

        <Album Title="SyntHuman" Image="images/albums/SyntHuman.jpg" Date="16/12/2021" Label="Mãe Solteira Records" Link="https://ndr0n.bandcamp.com/album/synthuman"
               Description="SyntHuman describes a process of transformation: physical transformation by embracing machine as an extension of biology; digital transformation by allowing machine generated decisions to guide the human generated composition process.

                    This
                    EP is designed as an
                    invocation to 
                    the destruction 
                    of dogma 
                    and to 
                    the acceptance 
                    of
                    the
                    beauty in
                    the synergy 
                    between human 
                    and
                    machine.

        <Album Title="White" Image="images/albums/White.jpg" Date="19/08/2020" Label="TruthTable" Link="https://ndr0n.bandcamp.com/album/white-2"
               Description="White exists in opposition to Black. Light cast upon Dark. Atonality uncovers melody, noise becomes harmony.

                    Transcendence is obtained through
                    digital
                    symbiosis.
                        Technology is evolution in
                    a programable 
                    algorithmical
                    system.
                        Emotion is binary code and it can
                    simulate
                    nirvana.

        <Album Title="Black" Image="images/albums/Black.jpg" Date="18/03/2020" Label="TruthTable" Link="https://ndr0n.bandcamp.com/album/black"
               Description="Black is the result of a month’s long exploration into minimalism, texture and sound. The EP was composed while the artist was living in South East London.
                        Through generative and algorithmic techniques, compositions emerge that defy personal preconceptions of rhythm and melody.By recording and sequencing these moments, Black is an attempt to humanize these mathematical processes.
                        A mixture of analogue and digital sound sources, the artist utilizes the best of both worlds when looking for its sonic identity.">
